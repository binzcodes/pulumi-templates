/**
 * Manages an EC2 Transit Gateway Connect Peer.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const exampleConnect = new aws.ec2transitgateway.Connect("exampleConnect", {
 *     transportAttachmentId: aws_ec2_transit_gateway_vpc_attachment.example.id,
 *     transitGatewayId: aws_ec2_transit_gateway.example.id,
 * });
 * const exampleConnectPeer = new aws.ec2transitgateway.ConnectPeer("exampleConnectPeer", {
 *     peerAddress: "10.1.2.3",
 *     insideCidrBlocks: "169.254.100.0/29",
 *     transitGatewayAttachmentId: exampleConnect.id,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * `aws_ec2_transit_gateway_connect_peer` can be imported by using the EC2 Transit Gateway Connect Peer identifier, e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:ec2transitgateway/connectPeer:ConnectPeer example tgw-connect-peer-12345678
 * ```
