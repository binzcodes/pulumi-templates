/**
 * Manages a CloudFormation StackSet Instance. Instances are managed in the account and region of the StackSet after the target account permissions have been configured. Additional information about StackSets can be found in the [AWS CloudFormation User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html).
 *
 * > **NOTE:** All target accounts must have an IAM Role created that matches the name of the execution role configured in the StackSet (the `executionRoleName` argument in the `aws.cloudformation.StackSet` resource) in a trust relationship with the administrative account or administration IAM Role. The execution role must have appropriate permissions to manage resources defined in the template along with those required for StackSets to operate. See the [AWS CloudFormation User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs.html) for more details.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** To retain the Stack during resource destroy, ensure `retainStack` has been set to `true` in the state first. This must be completed _before_ a deployment that would destroy the resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.cloudformation.StackSetInstance("example", {
 *     accountId: "123456789012",
 *     region: "us-east-1",
 *     stackSetName: aws_cloudformation_stack_set.example.name,
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Example IAM Setup in Target Account
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRoleAssumeRolePolicy = aws.iam.getPolicyDocument({
 *     statements: [{
 *         actions: ["sts:AssumeRole"],
 *         effect: "Allow",
 *         principals: [{
 *             identifiers: [aws_iam_role.AWSCloudFormationStackSetAdministrationRole.arn],
 *             type: "AWS",
 *         }],
 *     }],
 * });
 * const aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole = new aws.iam.Role("aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole", {assumeRolePolicy: aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRoleAssumeRolePolicy.then(aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRoleAssumeRolePolicy => aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRoleAssumeRolePolicy.json)});
 * const aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRoleMinimumExecutionPolicyPolicyDocument = aws.iam.getPolicyDocument({
 *     statements: [{
 *         actions: [
 *             "cloudformation:*",
 *             "s3:*",
 *             "sns:*",
 *         ],
 *         effect: "Allow",
 *         resources: ["*"],
 *     }],
 * });
 * const aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRoleMinimumExecutionPolicyRolePolicy = new aws.iam.RolePolicy("aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRoleMinimumExecutionPolicyRolePolicy", {
 *     policy: aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRoleMinimumExecutionPolicyPolicyDocument.then(aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRoleMinimumExecutionPolicyPolicyDocument => aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRoleMinimumExecutionPolicyPolicyDocument.json),
 *     role: aWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole.name,
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Example Deployment across Organizations account
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.cloudformation.StackSetInstance("example", {
 *     deploymentTargets: {
 *         organizationalUnitIds: [aws_organizations_organization.example.roots[0].id],
 *     },
 *     region: "us-east-1",
 *     stackSetName: aws_cloudformation_stack_set.example.name,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * CloudFormation StackSet Instances that target an AWS Account ID can be imported using the StackSet name, target AWS account ID, and target AWS region separated by commas (`,`) e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:cloudformation/stackSetInstance:StackSetInstance example example,123456789012,us-east-1
 * ```
 *
 *  CloudFormation StackSet Instances that target AWS Organizational Units can be imported using the StackSet name, a slash (`/`) separated list of organizational unit IDs, and target AWS region separated by commas (`,`) e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:cloudformation/stackSetInstance:StackSetInstance example example,ou-sdas-123123123/ou-sdas-789789789,us-east-1
 * ```
