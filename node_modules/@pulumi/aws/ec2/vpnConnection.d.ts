/**
 * Manages a Site-to-Site VPN connection. A Site-to-Site VPN connection is an Internet Protocol security (IPsec) VPN connection between a VPC and an on-premises network.
 * Any new Site-to-Site VPN connection that you create is an [AWS VPN connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/vpn-categories.html).
 *
 * > **Note:** The CIDR blocks in the arguments `tunnel1InsideCidr` and `tunnel2InsideCidr` must have a prefix of /30 and be a part of a specific range.
 * [Read more about this in the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_VpnTunnelOptionsSpecification.html).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### EC2 Transit Gateway
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const exampleTransitGateway = new aws.ec2transitgateway.TransitGateway("exampleTransitGateway", {});
 * const exampleCustomerGateway = new aws.ec2.CustomerGateway("exampleCustomerGateway", {
 *     bgpAsn: "65000",
 *     ipAddress: "172.0.0.1",
 *     type: "ipsec.1",
 * });
 * const exampleVpnConnection = new aws.ec2.VpnConnection("exampleVpnConnection", {
 *     customerGatewayId: exampleCustomerGateway.id,
 *     transitGatewayId: exampleTransitGateway.id,
 *     type: exampleCustomerGateway.type,
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Virtual Private Gateway
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const vpc = new aws.ec2.Vpc("vpc", {cidrBlock: "10.0.0.0/16"});
 * const vpnGateway = new aws.ec2.VpnGateway("vpnGateway", {vpcId: vpc.id});
 * const customerGateway = new aws.ec2.CustomerGateway("customerGateway", {
 *     bgpAsn: "65000",
 *     ipAddress: "172.0.0.1",
 *     type: "ipsec.1",
 * });
 * const main = new aws.ec2.VpnConnection("main", {
 *     vpnGatewayId: vpnGateway.id,
 *     customerGatewayId: customerGateway.id,
 *     type: "ipsec.1",
 *     staticRoutesOnly: true,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * VPN Connections can be imported using the `vpn connection id`, e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:ec2/vpnConnection:VpnConnection testvpnconnection vpn-40f41529
 * ```
