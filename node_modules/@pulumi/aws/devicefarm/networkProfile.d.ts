/**
 * Provides a resource to manage AWS Device Farm Network Profiles.
 * ∂
 * > **NOTE:** AWS currently has limited regional support for Device Farm (e.g., `us-west-2`). See [AWS Device Farm endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/devicefarm.html) for information on supported regions.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const exampleProject = new aws.devicefarm.Project("exampleProject", {});
 * const exampleNetworkProfile = new aws.devicefarm.NetworkProfile("exampleNetworkProfile", {projectArn: exampleProject.arn});
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * DeviceFarm Network Profiles can be imported by their arn
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:devicefarm/networkProfile:NetworkProfile example arn:aws:devicefarm:us-west-2:123456789012:networkprofile:4fa784c7-ccb4-4dbf-ba4f-02198320daa1
 * ```
