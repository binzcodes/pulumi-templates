/**
 * Provides a resource to manage an S3 Access Point.
 *
 * > **NOTE on Access Points and Access Point Policies:** This provider provides both a standalone Access Point Policy resource and an Access Point resource with a resource policy defined in-line. You cannot use an Access Point with in-line resource policy in conjunction with an Access Point Policy resource. Doing so will cause a conflict of policies and will overwrite the access point's resource policy.
 *
 * > Advanced usage: To use a custom API endpoint for this resource, use the `s3control` endpoint provider configuration), not the `s3` endpoint provider configuration.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### AWS Partition Bucket
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const exampleBucketV2 = new aws.s3.BucketV2("exampleBucketV2", {});
 * const exampleAccessPoint = new aws.s3.AccessPoint("exampleAccessPoint", {bucket: exampleBucketV2.id});
 * ```
 * ### S3 on Outposts Bucket
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const exampleBucket = new aws.s3control.Bucket("exampleBucket", {bucket: "example"});
 * const exampleVpc = new aws.ec2.Vpc("exampleVpc", {cidrBlock: "10.0.0.0/16"});
 * const exampleAccessPoint = new aws.s3.AccessPoint("exampleAccessPoint", {
 *     bucket: exampleBucket.arn,
 *     vpcConfiguration: {
 *         vpcId: exampleVpc.id,
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * For Access Points associated with an AWS Partition S3 Bucket, this resource can be imported using the `account_id` and `name` separated by a colon (`:`), e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:s3/accessPoint:AccessPoint example 123456789012:example
 * ```
 *
 *  For Access Points associated with an S3 on Outposts Bucket, this resource can be imported using the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:s3/accessPoint:AccessPoint example arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-east-1:123456789012:outpost/op-1234567890123456/accesspoint/example
 * ```
