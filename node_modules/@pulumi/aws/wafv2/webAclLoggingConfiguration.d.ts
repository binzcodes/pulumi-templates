/**
 * Creates a WAFv2 Web ACL Logging Configuration resource.
 *
 * > **Note:** To start logging from a WAFv2 Web ACL, an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose (e.g. `aws.kinesis.FirehoseDeliveryStream` resourc must also be created with a PUT source (not a stream) and in the region that you are operating.
 * If you are capturing logs for Amazon CloudFront, always create the firehose in US East (N. Virginia).
 * Be sure to give the data firehose, cloudwatch log group, and/or s3 bucket a name that starts with the prefix `aws-waf-logs-`.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### With Redacted Fields
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.wafv2.WebAclLoggingConfiguration("example", {
 *     logDestinationConfigs: [aws_kinesis_firehose_delivery_stream.example.arn],
 *     resourceArn: aws_wafv2_web_acl.example.arn,
 *     redactedFields: [{
 *         singleHeader: {
 *             name: "user-agent",
 *         },
 *     }],
 * });
 * ```
 * ### With Logging Filter
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.wafv2.WebAclLoggingConfiguration("example", {
 *     logDestinationConfigs: [aws_kinesis_firehose_delivery_stream.example.arn],
 *     resourceArn: aws_wafv2_web_acl.example.arn,
 *     loggingFilter: {
 *         defaultBehavior: "KEEP",
 *         filters: [
 *             {
 *                 behavior: "DROP",
 *                 conditions: [
 *                     {
 *                         actionCondition: {
 *                             action: "COUNT",
 *                         },
 *                     },
 *                     {
 *                         labelNameCondition: {
 *                             labelName: "awswaf:111122223333:rulegroup:testRules:LabelNameZ",
 *                         },
 *                     },
 *                 ],
 *                 requirement: "MEETS_ALL",
 *             },
 *             {
 *                 behavior: "KEEP",
 *                 conditions: [{
 *                     actionCondition: {
 *                         action: "ALLOW",
 *                     },
 *                 }],
 *                 requirement: "MEETS_ANY",
 *             },
 *         ],
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * WAFv2 Web ACL Logging Configurations can be imported using the WAFv2 Web ACL ARN e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:wafv2/webAclLoggingConfiguration:WebAclLoggingConfiguration example arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:regional/webacl/test-logs/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef
 * ```
