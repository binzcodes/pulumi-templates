/**
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * The following example below creates a CloudFront cache policy.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.cloudfront.CachePolicy("example", {
 *     comment: "test comment",
 *     defaultTtl: 50,
 *     maxTtl: 100,
 *     minTtl: 1,
 *     parametersInCacheKeyAndForwardedToOrigin: {
 *         cookiesConfig: {
 *             cookieBehavior: "whitelist",
 *             cookies: {
 *                 items: ["example"],
 *             },
 *         },
 *         headersConfig: {
 *             headerBehavior: "whitelist",
 *             headers: {
 *                 items: ["example"],
 *             },
 *         },
 *         queryStringsConfig: {
 *             queryStringBehavior: "whitelist",
 *             queryStrings: {
 *                 items: ["example"],
 *             },
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Cloudfront Cache Policies can be imported using the `id`, e.g.,
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import aws:cloudfront/cachePolicy:CachePolicy policy 658327ea-f89d-4fab-a63d-7e88639e58f6
 * ```
